We use data that was published with the article
Fr√∂hlich, F., Reiser, A., Fink, L. et al. Multi-experiment nonlinear mixed effect modeling of single-cell translation kinetics after transfection. npj Syst Biol Appl 4, 42 (2018).

The data is published on

From this directory, we use the files `code/project/data/20160427_mean_eGFP.xlsx` and `code/project/data/20160427_mean_d2eGFP.xlsx`.

We randomly select 100 fluorescence trajectories from both datasets by running the `R` script `R_code/sampling_from_experimental_data.R`.
